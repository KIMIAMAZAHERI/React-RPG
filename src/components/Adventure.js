//Adventure is where the game takes place - where you end up when you hit "Play"
//Keep it simple. 

//Plan is to make a simple game using the pokeapi. 
//When user logs in they can choose an opponent and start match
//Opponent is a random character with random attack and random everything. 

//There is a grid with pokemons. 
//User chooses a character to play so there is an onClick that sets the player
//User then clicks button to start match (ie another onClick that opens a div with a background)
//Button for attack (also onClick)
//When clicking button it sets of a random attack from characters specifications

//Need function for a miss as well. Might be an extra. 

//Question marks: 
//Is the health bar included in the API? 
//Second component for the match? Arena.js ? 

const Adventure = () => {
    return (
        <div>Adventure time</div>
